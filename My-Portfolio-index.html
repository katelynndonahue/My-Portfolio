          I am a Web Developer with a background in graphic design, retail
          management and spent a formative year as a longterm substitute science
          teacher in a Catholic high school. I love science, reading, spending
          time with my family and friends,
          <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i>. I
          am a plant mom and hedgehog mom to my angel, Ginger. I love music,
          anything from Led Zeppelin to A Tribe Called Quest and my favorite tv
          shows include:
          <ul>
            <i>Seinfeld,</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <i>Scrubs,</i>

              My first project for my bootcamp was to design an application that
              solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from
              multiple server-side API requests while leveraging a new style of
              css. It was to challenge us to work as a team as well as to learn
              this new style while combatting many issues from deciding what the
              focus of our project would be to many issues with merging and pull
              requests through GitHub.

            <p>
              I created a weather dashboard to work with api keys to gain
              experience for our first project, My Best Friend. I used
              OpenWeather for api keys to get accurate data to find the
              temperature, humidity and UV index for any given city.
