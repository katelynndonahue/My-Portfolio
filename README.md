# My-Portfolio
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio to showcase my work to potential future employers as well as to keep record of it with careful preservation and an aesthetically pleasing design to compliment my personal style.
- Through this project I learned better how to work with html and css and how to use it with my personal style and preference in mind.

## Installation
I began by creating a repo in GitHub so that I could work locally but have all of my work and commits shown through a safe server.
While working locally, I used VS Code to work through my html and css to create an aesthetically pleasing layout that properly displayed my personal style to promote my personal brand.
## Usage <!-- Need help with --> 
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
