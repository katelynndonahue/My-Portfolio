          I am a Web Developer with a background in graphic design, retail

          time with my family and friends,
          <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i>. I

              My first project for my bootcamp was to design an application that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests while leveraging a new style of css. It was to challenge us to work as a team as well as to learn this new style while combatting many issues from deciding what the focus of our project would be to many issues with merging and pull requests through GitHub.

          <p>For our second project of the bootcamp, my group created an application to search for Podcasts, have the ability to log in to save our new favorites and to add notes to them to personal reference. This project proved challenging in many different ways. I was responsible for creating the carousel function that was to be used to feature random podcasts, however, vital back end coding took precedence and due to time constraints, the carousel feature was unable to be added to our final project. I forked the repo and am able to continue working on the project to hopefully eventually add the feature and to make some edits that time did not allow prior.</p>

              I created a timed, ten question code game consisting of 
              trivia questions from my favorite movie, <i>Harry Potter</i>. 
              I found the execution difficult and intend to revisit 
              this project to improve my understanding of the syntax.

              I created a weather dashboard to work with API keys to gain
              experience for our first project, My Best Friend. I used
              OpenWeather for API keys to get accurate data to find the
              temperature, humidity and UV index for any given city.
