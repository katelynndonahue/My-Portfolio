# My-Portfolio

## Description
- My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio to showcase my work to potential future employers as well as to keep record of it with careful preservation and an aesthetically pleasing design to compliment my personal style.
- Through this project I learned better how to work with html and css and how to use it with my personal style and preference in mind. 
- In my most recent update, I've added my second project for the bootcamp, a podcast search and save application called Project411.
- I continue to struggle with the syntax but am becoming more comfortable as we continue

## Installation
I began by creating a repo in GitHub so that I could work locally but have all of my work and commits shown through a safe server.
While working locally, I used VS Code to work through my html and css to create an aesthetically pleasing layout that properly displayed my personal style to promote my personal brand.
