          I am a Web Developer with a background in graphic design, retail
          management and spent a formative year as a longterm substitute science
          teacher in a Catholic high school. I love science, reading, spending
          time with my family and friends,
          <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i>. I
          am a plant mom and hedgehog mom to my angel, Ginger. I love music,
          anything from Led Zeppelin to A Tribe Called Quest and my favorite tv
          shows include:
          <ul>
            <i>Seinfeld,</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <i>Scrubs,</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            and
            <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</i>
          </ul>

                <p>My first project for my bootcamp was to design an application that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests while leveraging a new style of css. It was to challenge us to work as a team as well as to learn this new style while combatting many issues from deciding what the focus of our project would be to many issues with merging and pull requests through GitHub.</p>
